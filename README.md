# When as the golden age of video games

# Dataset
In this project, I analyzed video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. I also searched for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and explored the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data  using SQL.

The database contains two tables which was limited (by datacamp) to 400 rows or each table.

# Summary  of findings
* 2007, 1998 and 2002 , three years that both users and critics agreed were in the top ten!
